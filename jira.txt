SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) Services**** These webservices can understand the standard.

SOAP services XML only use to send/receive the information/message between application/platform.

SOAP envelope root element for every SOAP message and contains two child elements <Header>[Optional] element and mandatory <Body> element.

What is WSDL?
Contract of webservices description language.
All the information send/receive into XML format as per WSDL define.
WSDL is the Heart of SOAP webservices.

In the XML file of WSDL we have binding and further dividing into Operations which will connect with type.

For example : Calculate: ADD is operations and IntA[type] and IntB[type] will be the two inputs.

+++++++++REST+++++++++ This is the latest authorization and communication ++++++++++++++++

Most of the org. moving into REST API's as SOAP is little complicated and dependent on single.

**************REST webservices are secure and fast.***************

XML or JSON will be use to send/receive the information.

############90% we used JSON for REST API's. All the REST information will be define in API document.

In API document we define minimum below to understand at list:
API Name
API Description
API Version
API Method ---- e.g. PUT, POST, GET or DELETE
API Request
API response

We use a multi API to take the information from different API provider. e.g. google maps exposed rest api's information.
A document should be available to understand the api's as above define.

API Key :  6deb0a89b91fc6a965fb2ac1bbb65053
Most of the API provider will be free upto 50 hits for single IP address per 60 seconds. It will be good to use it very less.

CRUD Operations:

create:POST ---- Sending something to save while doing operation
read: GET  ------ Receive something from the operation
update: PUT  ----- Put updating the the information for e.g. email or password updating
delete: DELETE  ---- Deleting something from the operation

Feature: Account Holder withdraws cash

  Scenario: Account has sufficient funds
   Given the account balance is $100
     And the card is valid
     And the machine contains enough money  
    When the Account Holder requests $20
    Then the ATM should dispense $20
     And the account balance should be $80
     And the card should be returned

HTTP methods which are commonly used to communicate with Rest API’s are

GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE

GET- The GET method is used to extract information from the given server using a given URI. While using GET request, it should only extract data and should have no other effect on the data. No Payload/Body required

How to send input data in GET?
Ans: Using Query Parameters

POST- A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

How to send input data in POST?
Ans: Using Form Parameters /Body Payload

PUT- Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

DELETE- Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.

Resources:
Resources represent API/Collection which can be accessed from the Server

Google.com/maps
google.com/search
google.com/images


Path Parameters:
Path parameters are variable parts of a URL path. They are typically used to point to a specific resource within a collection, such as a user identified by ID

Query Parameters:
Query Parameter is used to sort/filter the resources.

Query Parameters are identified with?””

Headers represent the meta-data associated with the API request and response. In layman terms, we were sending Additional details to API to process our request.
Example : Authorization details
